# roots-factorio-mod
a factorio mod that adds a roots resource and various wood/stone based items to the game

new resource: Roots
temp graphic is just a brown recolor. mining it gives you raw wood.

new items/entities: stone inserter, wood transport belt, wooden mining drill, stone axe and wood cog
various weaker versions of existing technology, built from wood and stone.

the starting items have been changed to give a slower start to the game, to make use of the new weaker technology, but not a lot of balancing has been done to ensure the progress curve is enjoyable.
